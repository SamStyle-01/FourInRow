Rules of the game "Four in a row"

Purpose of the game: Collect four of your chips in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

How to play:

1. Game board: The game board is a vertical board consisting of columns and rows. Each column can accommodate a chip.

2. Player chips: Two players play, each of whom has their own chips. One player plays with chips of one color (for example, red), and the other player plays with chips of a different color (for example, yellow).

3. Moves: Players take turns placing their chips in any free column on the playing field. The chip always falls down to the first free space in the column.

4. Victory: The goal of each player is to get four of his pieces in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If the player manages to fulfill this condition first, he wins.

5. Draw: If all the squares on the playing field are filled and no player has collected four tiles in a row, the game ends in a draw.

Tip: Try to block your opponent's moves to prevent him from winning, and build your own combinations to achieve victory!
